    <h2>Question 3</h2>
    <p>Q: If you like anime what is your favorite anime?</p>
    <p>A: I don't watch anime, but if Avatar TLA counts then it would definitely be that.</p>
    <h2>Question 4</h2>
    <p>Q: If you could have any super power what would it be?</p>
    <p>A: I don't have a great answer to this, but maybe time traveling without any negative consequences.</p>
    <h2>Question 5</h2>
    <p>Q: What is one place you want to travel to?</p>
    <p>A: There are lots of cool places I'd like to travel to, but the first thing I can think of is New Zealand or Australia.</p>
    <h2>Question 6</h2>
    <p>Q: What's everyone's favorite Pringles flavor?</p>
    <p>A: Just the good ol' fashioned kind.</p>
    <h2>Question 7</h2>
    <p>Q: Favorite animal?</p>
    <p>A: I want to say dogs, but when I was really young it used to be zebras, which is probably a lot more interesting. Hedgehogs are cool too!</p>
    <h2>Question 8</h2>
    <p>Q: Do you have a sport that you love to play?</p>
    <p>A: I used to play soccer when I was young and loved it!</p>
    <h2>Question 9</h2>
    <p>Q: What is your favorite genre of music and/or artist?</p>
    <p>A: I loooove many artists and genres so it's hard to say. I tend to gravitate towards alt rock/pop. Hozier, Elton John, and twenty one pilots are probably my top 3 fav artists.</p>
    <h2>Question 10</h2>
    <p>Q: Peppermint in your hot cocoa, or no?</p>
    <p>A: Absolutely, whenever I have any.</p>
    <h2>Question 11</h2>
    <p>Q: Are you a fan of BTS? Who is your bias?</p>
    <p>A: I don't regularly listen to them but I do like a couple of their singles! I don't have a bias.</p>
    <h2>Question 12</h2>
    <p>Q: Do blind people see only black or is the concept of color non-existent so they see nothing?</p>
    <p>A: I think it depends on the type of blindness, like if they were blind from birth and if they are only partially blind... Maybe they see black but maybe it's like they just don't have the sense anymore. Like if you lost your sense of smell completely.</p>
    <h2>Question 13</h2>
    <p>Q:What is your favorite food?</p>
    <p>A: Steamed pork Chinese dumplings!</p>
    <h2>Question 14</h2>
    <p>Q: Do you guys like to watch anime?</p>
    <p>A: I've never really watched anime except for a movie or two, so I guess not.</p>
    <h2>Question 15</h2>
    <p>Q: What is your favorite game?</p>
    <p>A: Animal crossing!</p>
    <h2>Question 16</h2>
    <p>Q: What is a legitimate food/dish you've never eaten, that you hope you will never have to eat?</p>
    <p>A: Squid, octopus, deer, rabbit, cow tounge......</p>
    <h2>Question 17</h2>
    <p>Q: What is your biggest fear?</p>
    <p>A: Being completely alone with no ability to contact anyone.</p>
    <h2>Question 18</h2>
    <p>Q: Does pineapple belong on pizza?</p>
    <p>A: Heck yeah, no shame. My go-to pizza order is Hawaiian (ham and pineapple). But the thing is, I don't think I'd like huge chunks. Small bits are great but IDK if I would want it to take up a whole bite.</p>
    <h2>Question 19</h2>
    <p>Q: If you had to be any insect, what insect would you be any why?</p>
    <p>A: A lightning bug/firefly!</p>
    <h2>Question 20</h2>
    <p>Q: If you guys have to either go back 10 years to the past and re-live your life without being able to change anything, or skip 10 years of your life, which one would you choose?</p>
    <p>A: Definitely the past, but do we know that we've gone back in time? It would be hard to relive 10 years without changing it with the knowlege of your present self. I'd still do it though to appreciate the moments I didn't appreciate before, but the bad moments would be harsh.</p>
